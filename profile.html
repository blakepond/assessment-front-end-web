                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Sagittarius, the centaur of the constelations. Born and raised in the Greater Idaho Falls area. I've been a man of the mountains all my life. 
                     The fall and winter are my seasons. I enjoy the beauty and deprevity of the changing seasons. I find that in life we experience changes; some seem to 
                    abhore it, I on the other hand embrace it. Just as the sun sets and rises, change is always apparent. Being a centaur mountain man brings alot of 
                interesting experiences and opportunities. Freedom to roam, freedom to think and to dream. For this is all I think about. Freedom, and how to obtain it. 
            Certainly, nothing in life is free, everthing is payed with a price especially, freedom. Hence, I have embraced technology as a means of buidling a self-sustaining 
        model by which one may do so should they wish to collaborate.  </p>
